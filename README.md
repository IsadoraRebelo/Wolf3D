## <b> Summary: </b><br>
Wolfenstein 3D is a seminal game in the pantheon of early video games. Developed by
Id Software by the über famous John Carmack and John Romero, published in 1992
by Apogee Software, Wolfenstein 3D is the first true “First Person Shooter” in the
history of video games.

## <b> Introduction: </b><br>
Don’t let Wolfenstein 3D’s basic graphics and violent gameplay fool you! It is in fact a
highly complex and advanced game. There is a reason why John Carmack is considered
one of the world’s best coders.
<p>
In this project you must follow in the footsteps of this brillant programmer and write
your own version of Wolfenstein 3D.
